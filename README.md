# ESP32S3-Wireless-Gamepad

This project will provide you with 2 codes. An ESP32S3 sender code and an ESP32S3 Receiver Code.

These are based off the Arduino ESP32-S3-Pico boards, latency is ultra low due to ESPNOW.

Change the MAC address of in the sender code to the ESP32S3 receiver mac to ensure communication. 

The receiver will also act as a HID Gamepad, using Tiny USB, so it will work straight away. Use Arduino IDE to program.
